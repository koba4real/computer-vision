This course had 4 assignments:

* [Panorama](ex1-panorama)

* [Fundamental matrix estimation](Fundamental_Initial)

* [Disparity map estimation with local methods (using seeds)](seeds_Initial)

* [Disparity map estimation with graph cuts](GCDisparity_Initial)


All the code is in C++ and can be compiled using the `CMakeLists.txt` on each directory.
